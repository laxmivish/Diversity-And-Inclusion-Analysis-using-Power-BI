# Diversity-And-Inclusion-Analysis-using-Power-BI
The project aimed to analyze gender diversity and performance metrics to gain insights into the composition of our workforce and identify areas for improvement. Key metrics examined included the number of men, number of women, number of leavers, employee promotions in FY21, percentage of women promoted, percentage of male and female hires, employee turnover, and average performance ratings for men and women.
The outcomes of this project provide valuable insights into gender diversity and its impact on employee performance. By promoting an inclusive work environment and leveraging these insights, we are confident in our ability to enhance gender diversity, talent retention, and overall organizational success.
